                    "Get busy living, or get busy dying." Favorite quotes can say a lot about a person: who we are,
                    where
                    we'regoing, what'simportant to us, and, yes, even our favorite movie. If you haven't placed the
                    quote yet,
                    it's from the movie'Shawshank Redemption'. Now, I know that Tim Robbins was dealing with some very
                    drastic
                    life choices, but I've always loved thesentiment. </p><br>
                <p> Now that I've gotten the most important stuff out of the way, let me tell you a little about
                    myself.I was
                    born Lynn Cunningham in the picturesque little town of Pinetop, Arizona. For the first few years of
                    my life
                    I bounced betweenArizona and Texas where my parents worked in the child-care industry. This meant my
                    first
                    homes were in orphanages, but unlike theother children in residence, I had both of my parents. It
                    was a
                    pretty unorthodox adolescence.</P><br>
                <p> In 1997 I moved to Tucson. I married my husband and we formed Affordable Fence and Gates which is an
                    ornamental iron contracting business. It started with just the two of us: my husband handled the
                    building
                    and installation and I managed the books. It has grown quite a bit over the years. We no longer work
                    out of
                    our home and we have grown to 25 employees.</p><br>
                <p> I have two incredible kids. My daughter is 18 and attending U of A and my son is a 16 year old
                    JunioratCanyon Del Oro High School. I love to scuba dive, hike, read, build our business and travel.
                    My
                    dream is to retire on a boat somewhere in the Mediteranian Ocean while I freelance as a web
                    designer.</p>
