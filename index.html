    <p>"Get busy living, or get busy dying." Favorite quotes can say a lot about a person: who we are, where we're going, what's 
        important to us, and, yes, even our favorite movie. If you haven't placed the quote yet, it's from the movie 'Shawshank Redemption'. 
        Now, I know that Tim Robbins was dealing with some very drastic life choices, but I've always loved the sentiment.
        Now that I've gotten the most important stuff out of the way, let me tell you a little about myself. I was born Lynn Cunningham in 
        the picturesque little town of Pinetop, Arizona. For the first few years of my life I bounced between Arizona and Texas where my 
        parents worked in the child-care industry. This meant my first homes were in orphanages, but unlike the other children in residence,
        I had both of my parents. It was a pretty unorthodox adolescense.
        In 1997 I moved to Tucson. I married my husband and we formed Affordable Fence and Gates which is an ornamental iron contracting 
        business. It started with just the two of us: my husband handled the building and installation and I managed the books. It has grown
        quite a bit over the years. We no longer work out of our home and we have grown to 25 employees.
        I have two incredible kids. My daughter is 18 and attending U of A and my son is a 16 year old Junior at Canyon Del Oro High School. 
        I love to scuba dive, hike, read, build our business and travel. My dream is to retire on a boat somewhere in the Mediteranian Ocean 
        while I freelance as a web designer.</p>
